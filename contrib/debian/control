 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Dash Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
 .
 This package provides the daemon, monead, and the CLI tool
 monea-cli to interact with the daemon.

Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer digital currency - standalone transaction tool

 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Dash uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Dash Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
 .
 This package provides monea-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a monea daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
